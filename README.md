# Captain-Nuke-FPS-Game
A personal Android FPS project with two modes, multiple environment types, wave system, objective system, and small scale story arc.
The game includes my own personal creation, a level manager with built in enemy spawner. Each level can have multiple waves and each wave can have different types of enemies and objectives. The game also features a simple yet effective "actionable collider" which acts as an interactable object that can have multiple use cases. The actionable collider class can easily be utlized as an interface if project scale is to be increased in the future.
